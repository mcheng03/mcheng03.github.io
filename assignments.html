    <h1>BU CS 506 Assignments</h1>

    <h2>Website Creation</h2>
    <p>I built this website using the Minimal theme from Jekyll with the help of ChatGPT, which guided me through the process of setting up and customizing the site. I created a GitHub Pages repository named mcheng03.github.io to host my personal website, which automatically configured GitHub Pages to serve the site. I installed and customized the Minimal theme by adding it to my Jekyll configuration (_config.yml). This provided a straightforward layout that includes sections like About Me, Work Experience, Projects, Contact, and Assignments. I added a personal touch by including my profile picture, a quote, and styled buttons that link to my GitHub repositories.</p>

    <h2>Assignment 0</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this assignment was to practice submitting assignments for the course using Git and Github. I created a Python script that adds two numbers together and prints their sum to the command line. I added the script to the staging area (git add), committed my changes with a message (git commit), and finally pushed my code to the designated repository (git push origin main). The link can be found below:</p>

    <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
    <p>In this assignment, the CS 506 class collectively recorded a dataset with elevator arrival times on the ground floor of CDS. I practiced collecting, interacting and visualizing the data and made a hypothesis based on training data, which was then evaluated on testing data. I learned a few things about dealing with time data and probabilities. I answered several questions regarding my results and have determined an optimal waiting location at the CDS lobby. The link can be found below:</p>

    <h2>Assignment 3</h2>
    <p>
        In this assignment, I implemented Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to perform dimensionality reduction on the MNIST dataset. 
        I compared accuracy scores with different numbers of components, tracked the training time of a logistic regression model using SVD-preprocessed data, 
        and visualized the top singular vectors that captured the most important patterns. The link can be found below:

    <h2>Assignment 5</h2>
    <p>
        Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model from scratch to predict customer churn for a bank. 
        The goal was to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank based on historical data. Performed data preprocessing (scaling, label encoding, and outlier removal),
        hyperparameter tuning (using k-fold cross-validation), and finally trained the model for testing. Predictions have been submitted to a private Kaggle competition. The link to the Jupyter file can be found below:

    <h2>Midterm</h2>
    <p>
        Attempted to predict people's star ratings as accurate as possible based on their review without using any neural networks or deep learning methods. My process can be summed in two parts: 
        feature engineering and model building. Used sentiment analysis tools like TextBlob and VADER, calculated basic text statistics such as length of setence and number of exclamation marks, 
        and finally used TF-IDF and LSA on preprocessed text to hopefully capture any meaningful information from text columns (a brief summary and the actual review itself). Ultimately decided to use 
        an XGBoost model because of its well-established performance in handling large datasets efficiently, robustness in capturing complex patterns, and versatility in classification 
        (in this case, an ordinal scale of number of stars). Results were submitted to a private Kaggle competition. The link to the Jupyter file and accompanying paper can be found below:
