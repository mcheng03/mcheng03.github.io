# BU CS 506 Assignments

## Website Creation
I built this website using the Minimal theme from Jekyll with the help of ChatGPT, which guided me through the process of setting up and customizing the site. I created a GitHub Pages repository named mcheng03.github.io to host my personal website, which automatically configured GitHub Pages to serve the site. I installed and customized the Minimal theme by adding it to my Jekyll configuration (_config.yml). This provided a straightforward layout that includes sections like About Me, Work Experience, Projects, Contact, and Assignments. I added a personal touch by including my profile picture, a quote, and styled buttons that link to my GitHub repositories.

## Assignment 0
The purpose of this assignment was to practice submitting assignments for the course using Git and Github. I created a Python script that adds two numbers together and prints their sum to the command line. I added the script to the staging area (git add), committed my changes with a message (git commit), and finally pushed my code to the designated repository (git push origin main). The link can be found below:

## Assignment 1
In this assignment, the CS 506 class collectively recorded a dataset with elevator arrival times on the ground floor of CDS. I practiced collecting, interacting and visualizing the data and made a hypothesis based on training data, which was then evaluated on testing data. I learned a few things about dealing with time data and probabilities. I answered several questions regarding my results and have determined an optimal waiting location at the CDS lobby.
