### About Me

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Data Science with a strong interest in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization. Through my coursework and projects, I've gained hands-on experience with tools like Python, R, and SQL, and I enjoy using them to uncover insights from data. 

I’m passionate about applying data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems, from analyzing trends in business to predicting outcomes in various fields. Currently, I’m exploring advanced machine learning algorithms and their applications in areas such as criminal justice and environmental science.

In my free time, I love reading fiction novels and spending time with my puppy.
